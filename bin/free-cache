# This script flushes the file system buffers and clears memory caches.
# 
# From the man page:
#
# /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches (since Linux 2.6.16)
#
#   Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries and
#   inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
#
#   To free pagecache, use echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
#   To free dentries and inodes, use echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
#   To free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
